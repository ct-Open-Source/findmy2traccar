# findmy2traccar

This python script forwards AirTag reports to the [GPS Tracker Server 'Traccar'](https://github.com/traccar/traccar). It is based on [biemsters Project 'FindMy'](https://github.com/biemster/FindMy) and requires the steps mentioned in his repository to work. In addition, you need to create a Folder named `.keys` and place your keys in them. The script re-reads that folder with every round, so adding keys during runtime is possible.

Further explaination is provided in c't and on heise+ (to be released).
